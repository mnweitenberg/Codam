# Exam rank 06
In three hours (without internet connection) we have to write 2 programs:
- prime_factorization, create a C program that receives a positive integer as input and, if feasible, displays the prime factors of that number
- counting_islands, create a program to read a file consisting of lines of equal length, composed of '.' and 'X' characters, with 'X' characters forming "islands". The program should replace each 'X' with a number representing the order of its "island" in the file, display the modified file content, and manage errors or empty files appropriately.
